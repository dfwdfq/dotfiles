#+title: dotfiles
#+author: dfwdfq

The main goal of this repository is to create *reproducible* custom user space for any GNU/Linux
distribution I use. It's collection of *dotfiles*, *documentation* and *bootstrapping scripts*.
*Personal philosophy of computation* included. 


* What's inside?
** ~Qtile~ : window manager
I did not roll my own window manager for X server, so I use this one.
*Window manager* is a component of *desktop environment*, and I use
this one to build my own workflow. Maybe I will replace it with my own in future.

** ~The holy trinity~
Since I /prefer TUI over GUI/, I consider myself a _terminal monk_.
I spend most of my time in the *terminal*, and the programs listed below are the holy trinity:
the *terminal*, where I run my *shell* to perform most operations, and *the editor*,
which is my primary instrument.

*** ~kitty~ : terminal

** ~Other tools~
Below are 2 sections. Section of /custom tools/ are written by
me and solves particular tasks. They can be find on my Github.
/Non custom tools/ are programs that can be found in standard
repositories and therefore installed with package manager of
choosen GNU/Linux distribution.

* Documentation
In perfect world documentation is created automatically. We don't live in perfect world.

* Personal philosophy of computation
First, such a philosophy remains personal because there is no silver bullet and
it's impossible to find a superposition that satisfies all existing user requirements.

Second, why would someone seriously call it philosophy? To answer this question,
one must understand the Unix philosophy—particularly as documented in *Eric Raymond's The Art of Unix Programming*.

So to define my personal philosophy of computation I provide *3 documents*:
