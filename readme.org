* What's inside?
** ~Qtile~ : window manager
** The holy trinity
Since I prefer /TUI over GUI/ I consider myself a terminal monk.
I spend most of my time in terminal and listed below programs
are holy trinity. *Terminal*, where I run my *shell* to perform
most of operations and *editor* that is my primary instrument.
