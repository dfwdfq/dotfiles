* What's inside?
** ~Qtile~ : window manager
I did not roll my own window manager for X server, so I use this one.
*Window manager* is a component of *desktop environment*, and I use
this one to build my own workflow. Maybe I will replace with my own in future.

** The holy trinity
Since I /prefer TUI over GUI/, I consider myself a _terminal monk_.
I spend most of my time in the *terminal*, and the programs listed below are the holy trinity:
the *terminal*, where I run my *shell* to perform most operations, and *the editor*,
which is my primary instrument.
*** ~kitty~ : terminal

*** ~Emacs~ : editor

*** ~Fish~  : shell
