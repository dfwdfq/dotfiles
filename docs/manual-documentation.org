#+title: manual documentation
** What can not be automated?
In perfect world ~entire user space~ can be documented using some custom script written in Perl, Python,
Tcl, Ruby or whatever language you prefer(even bash). It's easy to generate documentation for any
dotfile, because all you need to do is to choose comment format and everytime you add something new to
your configuration file, just write comment that explains purpse and whatever you need to document.
Then script parses dotfile into documentation file.
Doxygene is good instrument to generate documentation for C++ project. ~SFML~ uses it, for example.
But how can I document all tools I use? How can I separate system stuff and obvious stuff most GNU/Linux
distros have from my specific tools? I see no way for it, so manual documentation is required to describe
tools you use for specific tools.
