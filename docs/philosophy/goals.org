#+title: Goals
Goals are implications of rules. They define the shape of user space to achieve and
answer one straight question - what is purpose of such system configuration?

** 0. Fully reproducible environment
A single bootstrap script rebuilds the entire user space.

** 1. Old-school Unix hacking
The system feels like a workshop of simple, composable tools.

** 2. Automatically documented
Documentation is generated from annotated sources, always in sync.

** 3. Fits into a single person's mind
The system is small and understandable in its entirety.

** 4. Alive system that evolves
The configuration is not static. It grows and changes to fit requirements.
The philosophy itself is versioned.
