#+title: Why fish?
My first shell was obviously *bash*. And it sucks.
Fish feels far better due to vast amount of included batteries.

* 0. Web-driven configuration
Run ~fish_config~ and then choose theme, prompt, bindings, e.t.c
It's far easier, then editing .bashrc

* 1. Auto-suggestions
No need to retype commands twice. Auto-suggestions increase productivity, since you
spend less time of monkeytyping.

* 2. reads man pages
It shows portion of man page for suggested command. It helps to remember commands.

* 3. Interactivity
There is an ability to select from suggested options.
