#+title: Why Kitty?
My first terminal was *iterm*. I've been using it for really long time.
I didn't know anything about terminal multeplexing, so I never heard about
*Tmux* or *Zellij*. It was ass in a pain, because I was required to spawn
several process of *iterm* and later my workspace was slowly becoming a mess.
*Kitty* changed everything.

* 0. Tabs
~ctrl+shift+T~ opens a new tab. No need to run another *Kitty*.x

* 1. GPU rendering
I can watch videos and render real graphics in terminal.

* 2. Kittens
*ssh*, *icat*, *diff* - extends your abilities.

* 3. Hackability
It's hackable and I can tune terminal to exact state I need.
