* Fonts
I use JetBrains Mono. Bold/italic faces are automatically resolved.

font_family JetBrains Mono
bold_font auto
italic_font auto
bold_italic_font auto
font_size 20.0

* Key Modifier
The primary modifier for Kitty shortcuts is set to Ctrl+Shift to avoid conflicts with shell keybindings.

kitty_mod ctrl+shift

* Mouse
Hide the mouse cursor after 3 seconds of inactivity to reduce visual clutter.

mouse_hide_wait 3.0

* Bell
I disable the audio bell because it sucks. The bell color is defined in the theme file.

enable_audio_bell no
visual_bell_duration 0.1
visual_bell_color

* Window Size
Kitty remembers the window size between launches. The initial dimensions are set for comfortable splits.

remember_window_size yes
initial_window_width 1200
initial_window_height 800

* Performance
Low repaint/input delays reduce latency. Sync‑to‑monitor prevents tearing.

repaint_delay 10
input_delay 3
sync_to_monitor yes

* Cursor
I prefer a steady block cursor (no blink) for precise editing.

cursor_shape block
cursor_blink_interval 0

* Scrollback
10000 lines of scrollback history, and the mouse wheel scrolls faster for quick navigation.

scrollback_lines 10000
wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

* URL Handling
URLs are double‑underlined; open with modifier+click using the default browser. Copy‑on‑select is enabled for efficiency.

url_style double
open_url_modifiers kitty_mod
open_url_with default
copy_on_select yes

* Theme
All colors are defined in an external file for easy switching.
